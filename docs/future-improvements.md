# Future Improvements for AI Blog Generator

This document tracks ideas and enhancements to consider in the future. These are not priorities for now, but may be valuable as the project evolves.

## Potential Improvements

- Add user authentication with OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Implement autosave and version history for blog drafts
- Support collaborative editing (multiple users on one post)
- Add image upload and AI-powered image generation for blog posts
- Integrate advanced SEO analysis and suggestions
- Enable scheduling and automated publishing of posts
- Add analytics dashboard for post performance
- Support exporting posts to external platforms (Medium, WordPress, etc.)
- Improve accessibility and mobile responsiveness
- Add localization/multilanguage support

Feel free to add more ideas as they arise! 

## Creating new blogs

- On the outline, I want version control, so that someone can revert to an earlier outline if they don't like the new one.

## Account Settings

- Remove the Avatar and fix the storage 


## Fix the Underlying Version Conflict (Best for Long-Term Health)

- react-day-picker@8.10.1 expects date-fns version ^2.28.0 or ^3.0.0.
- Your project has date-fns@4.1.0, which is not compatible.
- To fix: Uninstall the current version: npm uninstall date-fns
- Install a compatible version: npm install date-fns@3.6.0
