```

## Planned Integrations (Not Yet Implemented)

1. **Authentication**: UI is prepared for magic link authentication but needs to be connected to an actual service.
2. **AI Content Generation**: The interface for AI blog generation is designed but needs integration with an AI provider like OpenAI.
3. **Database**: The application needs a database connection to store user data, blog posts, and analytics.


## Current Limitations

1. The application currently uses mock data for all displays.
2. Authentication flow is designed but not functional.
3. AI content generation is simulated with pre-written content.
4. Blog post management actions (create, edit, delete) are client-side only.


This project represents a complete frontend implementation ready to be connected to backend services for full functionality.

## Getting Started

### Setting Up the AI Blog Generator Locally

Here's everything you need to install and set up to get the AI blog generator running on your local machine:

## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js and npm**

1. Install Node.js (version 18.17.0 or higher) which includes npm
2. Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
3. Verify installation with:

```shellscript
node --version
npm --version
```





2. **Git**

1. Install Git for version control
2. Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3. Verify installation with:

```shellscript
git --version
```


## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

If you've already pushed the code to GitHub:

```shellscript
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-blog-generator.git
cd ai-blog-generator
```

If you're working with downloaded files, just extract them to a folder and navigate to it in your terminal.

### 2. Install Dependencies

```shellscript
npm install
```

This will install all the required packages defined in the `package.json` file, including:

- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui components
- Lucide React icons


### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```plaintext
# For a basic setup, you might not need any environment variables yet
# When you integrate with actual services, you'll add them here

# Example for authentication service (when you implement it)
# AUTH_SECRET=your_auth_secret

# Example for AI integration (when you implement it)
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

### 4. Run the Development Server

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

This will start the Next.js development server. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## What's Included

The project is currently a frontend prototype with the following features:

- Homepage with typewriter effect
- Dashboard with mock analytics
- Blog posts management page with filtering and sorting
- Content ideas page
- Settings page
- Login and signup pages with magic link authentication UI (not functional yet)


## What's Not Included Yet

Since this is currently a frontend prototype, the following features are not yet functional and would require additional setup:

1. **Authentication**: The UI for magic link authentication is in place, but you would need to integrate with an authentication provider like Supabase, Auth.js, or Firebase.
2. **AI Content Generation**: The UI for generating blog content is in place, but you would need to integrate with an AI provider like OpenAI.
3. **Database**: There's no database connection yet. You would need to set up a database like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or a service like Supabase.


## Next Steps After Basic Setup

Once you have the frontend running, you might want to:

1. **Set up authentication**:

1. Sign up for an authentication service (Supabase, Auth.js, Clerk, etc.)
2. Add the required environment variables
3. Implement the server-side authentication logic

2. **Integrate with an AI service**:

1. Sign up for OpenAI or another AI provider
2. Add your API key to the environment variables
3. Implement the server-side API route for content generation

3. **Set up a database**:

1. Choose a database provider (Supabase, Neon, PlanetScale, etc.)
2. Create the necessary tables for users, blog posts, etc.
3. Implement the server-side logic for database operations


## Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Node.js version issues**: If you encounter errors, make sure you're using Node.js version 18.17.0 or higher.
2. **Port already in use**: If port 3000 is already in use, you can specify a different port:

```shellscript
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```


3. **Missing dependencies**: If you encounter errors about missing modules, try:

```shellscript
npm install --force
```


4. **TypeScript errors**: If you encounter TypeScript errors, they might be related to type definitions. Try:

```shellscript
npm install @types/react @types/node --save-dev
```




Let me know if you encounter any specific issues during the setup process!

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git
   cd yourrepo
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```shell
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```
3. **Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:**
   | Variable                   | Description                        |
   |---------------------------|------------------------------------|
   | NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL       | Your API URL                       |
   | AUTH_SECRET               | Your authentication secret          |
   | NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID  | (Optional) Analytics ID             |
   | OPENAI_API_KEY            | (Optional) For AI integration       |

4. **Run the development server:**
   ```shell
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```
5. **Open** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) **in your browser.**
