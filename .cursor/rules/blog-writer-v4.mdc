Development Rules & Guidelines
Context 7 Integration

Always use the context7 MCP server to reference documentation for libraries like Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Supabase, and OpenAI.
For the tokens, start with 5000 but then increase to 20,000 if your first search doesn't give relevant documentation.
Only search three times maximum for any specific piece of documentation. If you don't get what you need, use web search for a wider search.
